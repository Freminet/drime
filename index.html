    <h1>Analysis of Drime Cloud's E2EE and Zero-Knowledge Claims</h1>
    <p class="date">Original Report: October 2025 | Updated: December 2025</p>

   <div class="note">
        <p><div class="drime-message">
            Drime has now contacted me after a week of silence. My email to them can be found <a href="https://imgur.com/a/iHo53p8">here</a>.<br>
            <p><strong>Correction:</strong> Based on their technical feedback, I have removed the specific claims about the IV and server-side keys.
    
                <p><strong>However, the core issue remains:</strong> Drime violates the consumer expectation of E2EE because <strong>metadata is not encrypted</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>In their email, Drime characterizes their false "Zero-Knowledge" advertising as a <img src="screenshots/mistake.png" class="evidence-image">"mistake" by a non-technical team member. This excuse is unacceptable for a security company:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"Zero-Knowledge" is a specific architectural definition</strong>, not a vague marketing adjective like "fast" or "easy".</li>
                    <li>To advertise a product as "Zero-Knowledge" when the server can read filenames, directory structures, and file sizes is to <strong>fundamentally misrepresent the product's identity</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Attributing this to a "copywriting error" implies gross negligence. A privacy company should not allow non-technical staff to invent security features that do not exist.</li>
                </ul>
        </div></p>
        <p><strong>Status Update:</strong> This report has been updated with significant new findings regarding the underlying software architecture ("BeDrive") and proof of artificial data inflation. See <a href="#part2">"Part 2"</a> below.</p>
        <p>This page isn't made to shame Drime, but to ensure users understand what they're actually getting. </p>

        <p><strong>⚠️ WARNING:</strong> The technical evidence collected in this report indicates that Drime Cloud is engaging in behavior that meets the legal definitions of <br><strong>Deceptive Commercial Practices</strong>, <br><strong>GDPR Violations</strong> (specifically Transparency, Integrity, Confidentiality, and misrepresentation of 'Military-Grade' security measures), <br>and violations of the <strong>EU Digital Content Directive</strong> (Directive (EU) 2019/770 regarding Service Non-Conformity).</p>

        <h3>Drime lies about contacting me</h3>
        <img src="screenshots/reddit_comment2.png" alt="Screenshot of Drime's Reddit Comment" class="evidence-image" style="border: 1px solid #ffcdd2;">
        <p>Drime's founder has publicly stated on Reddit that they "reached out to me multiple times" and sent a "detailed response document" but that I "never replied".</p>
        
        <p><strong>This is a fabrication.</strong></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Timeline:</strong> My email address (sylphie@tuta.io) was <em>only</em> added to this report in the "Part 2" update (November 2025). Prior to this update, this report was anonymous and listed no contact information whatsoever(verifiable by Github history).</li>
            <li><strong>The Impossibility:</strong> It is physically impossible for Drime to have emailed me "multiple times" before November because the contact method did not exist. Unless Drime has found a way to send emails to the future, their claim is a lie designed to discredit this research.</li>
            <li><strong>The "Document":</strong> If Drime actually possesses a "detailed response document" that refutes these technical findings, they are free to publish it publicly. Hiding it behind a claim of "unanswered emails" suggests the document does not exist.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Drime has since provided screenshots of emails they claim to have sent, saying that someone else was contacting them before and that they thought that was me. However, the recipient address in the screenshots was censored. Since I never received these emails and the address was not verified, this claim remains unverified.
            <img src="screenshots/mistake.png" class="evidence-image">
            <p>It can be seen here that the email address is censored.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>This document examines the encryption claims made by Drime Cloud regarding their "Vault" feature. Through API analysis, I found significant discrepancies between their marketing statements and the actual implementation.</p>

    <p>Drime Cloud advertises their Vault as having "zero-knowledge" and "end-to-end encryption," stating that "Only you can see your files. Not us, not anyone else." However, API responses show that all file and folder metadata is transmitted in plaintext to their servers.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Drime Cloud is a file storage service based in the European Union. Their Vault feature is marketed as a secure, encrypted storage solution for sensitive files. The service claims to implement zero-knowledge encryption, which typically means that the service provider cannot access any user data, including metadata.</p>

    <h2>Marketing Claims</h2>
    <p>The following statements appear on Drime's official website at drime.cloud/vault:</p>

    <blockquote>
        "Drime end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) Vault provide the most secure way to store your most sensitive files in the cloud."
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        "Zero-knowledge: Only you can see your files. Not us, not anyone else. We don't store passwords, and we can't access your data."
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        "Your files are encrypted on your device and never leave it unprotected. Only you can access them, not even Drime."
    </blockquote>

    <p class="image-caption">Figure 1: Drime's "Zero-knowledge" marketing claim (Source: <a href="https://drime.cloud/vault" target="_blank">drime.cloud/vault</a>)</p>
    <div class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> They have since changed "Zero-knowledge" to "Secure Vault" on their website. The original page is archived at: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250726003342/https://drime.cloud/vault" target="_blank">web.archive.org</a>
        <br><br>
        Drime hasn't sent any notification of this change to their users and silently removed the "Zero-knowledge" claim from their website.
    </div>

    <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
    <p>When accessing the Vault feature, the client makes an API request to:</p>
    <pre>https://app.drime.cloud/api/v1/vault/file-entries</pre>

    <p>The response contains the following data structure:</p>

    <pre>{
    "id": 26833,
    "name": "My Confidential Tax Documents",
    "description": null,
    "file_name": "2024_tax_return.pdf",
    "mime": "application/pdf",
    "file_size": 2547891,
    "type": "folder",
    "extension": "pdf",
    "created_at": "2025-10-03T19:45:30.000000Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-10-05T16:38:35.000000Z",
    "path": "26833",
    "vault_id": 440,
    "is_encrypted": 1
}</pre>

    <h3>Exposed Metadata</h3>
    <p>The API response reveals the following information in plaintext:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Complete file and folder names</li>
        <li>File descriptions</li>
        <li>MIME types and file extensions</li>
        <li>Exact file sizes in bytes</li>
        <li>Complete directory structure</li>
        <li>Creation and modification timestamps</li>
        <li>Access patterns</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The response includes an "is_encrypted" flag set to 1, which appears to indicate that file contents are encrypted, but not the metadata.</p>

    <img src="screenshots/api_response.png" alt="API response showing plaintext metadata" class="evidence-image">
    <p class="image-caption">Figure 2: API response showing unencrypted metadata in browser DevTools</p>

    <h2>Comparison with Industry Standards</h2>
    <p>True zero-knowledge encryption implementations encrypt metadata on the client side before transmission. For comparison, pCloud's Crypto Folder service returns encrypted filenames:</p>

    <pre>{
    "name": "CM4LSAOHWDTXNPEJF2XZA67KOPDJ5XOJWACR3JVTT4KK3DRQBAE5RHIY4Z4IUKSDO4AM4ZODDSH7S",
    "encrypted": true,
    "contenttype": "application/octet-stream"
}</pre>

    <p>Other services implementing true zero-knowledge encryption include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Proton Drive - Uses PGP-based encryption for all metadata</li>
        <li>Tresorit - Client-side encryption of filenames and folder structure</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="image-caption">Figure 3: pCloud Crypto folder showing encrypted filename vs Drime's plaintext</p>

    <h2>Privacy Implications</h2>
    <p>The exposure of metadata has significant privacy implications:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Information Type</th>
            <th>Visible to Drime</th>
            <th>Privacy Risk</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>File names</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Reveals document subject matter</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Folder structure</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Shows organization and categories</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>File types</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Indicates content nature (medical, financial, etc.)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Access times</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Behavioral patterns and frequency</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>File sizes</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Can infer content complexity</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>This metadata can be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Accessed by Drime employees</li>
        <li>Subpoenaed by law enforcement</li>
        <li>Exposed in the event of a data breach</li>
        <li>Used for internal analytics or profiling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional Security Concern</h2>
    <p>The vault_id field uses sequential integers (440, 441, 442, etc.). This implementation allows any user to determine the total number of vaults created system-wide by creating and deleting vaults and observing the increment. This is a minor information disclosure that violates common security practices. Standard implementations use UUIDs or random identifiers to prevent enumeration.</p>

    <img src="screenshots/vault_id_exposed.png" alt="Sequential vault_id demonstration" class="evidence-image">
    <p class="image-caption">Figure 4: Sequential vault_id allowing enumeration of total vaults</p>

    <h2>Reproduction Steps</h2>
    <p>The findings can be verified using the following process:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Create a Drime account and enable the Vault feature</li>
        <li>Create folders with descriptive names (e.g., "Personal Medical Records")</li>
        <li>Upload files with recognizable filenames</li>
        <li>Open browser developer tools (F12) and navigate to the Network tab</li>
        <li>Access the Vault by entering the vault password</li>
        <li>Locate the API request to /api/v1/vault/file-entries</li>
        <li>Examine the JSON response body</li>
    </ol>

    <p>All metadata will be visible in plaintext in the response.</p>

    <h2>Company Response</h2>
    <p>When these findings were initially reported, Drime's team responded with the following statement:</p>

    <blockquote>
        "Drime Vault is a new feature, and we've already addressed these concerns. The file content is fully end-to-end encrypted, it's encrypted on your device before being uploaded. Some providers use the term 'zero knowledge,' which usually means that even metadata is encrypted. We plan to bring this level as well once Vault is fully stable."
    </blockquote>

    <p>In a subsequent response, they stated:</p>

    <blockquote>
        "We do not claim 'zero knowledge', and we've already clarified this in past discussions when asked."
    </blockquote>

    <p>This statement contradicts their marketing page, which explicitly includes a section titled "Zero-knowledge" with claims about data access.</p>

    <img src="screenshots/company_response.png" alt="Drime team response denying zero-knowledge claims" class="evidence-image">
    <p class="image-caption">Figure 5: Drime's response claiming they "do not claim 'zero knowledge'"</p>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>Note on Censorship:</strong> After posting these findings on their subreddit, my account was permanently banned and the post was removed along with the Drime team's response. This occurred shortly after their response received several upvotes.
    </div>

    <h2>Legal and Regulatory Considerations</h2>
    <p>Drime Cloud operates in the European Union and markets services to EU citizens. The discrepancy between marketing claims and actual implementation may raise concerns under several regulatory frameworks:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>GDPR Article 5 requires accuracy and transparency in data processing claims</li>
        <li>The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive prohibits misleading advertising</li>
        <li>Consumer protection laws require truthful product representations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The use of terms like "zero-knowledge" and statements such as "Not us, not anyone else" while maintaining server-side visibility of metadata could be considered misleading to consumers making security decisions.</p>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <p>For Drime Cloud:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Update marketing materials to accurately reflect what data is and is not encrypted</li>
        <li>Remove or clarify the "zero-knowledge" claims until metadata encryption is implemented</li>
        <li>Provide clear documentation about what information is visible to the service</li>
        <li>Implement UUID-based identifiers instead of sequential integers</li>
        <li>Provide a specific timeline for implementing metadata encryption</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For users considering Drime Vault:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand that file and folder names are visible to Drime's servers</li>
        <li>Assume metadata can be accessed by the company and legal authorities</li>
        <li>Consider whether the current level of encryption meets your threat model</li>
        <li>Evaluate alternative services if metadata privacy is critical</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion (Part 1)</h2>
    <p>Drime Vault appears to implement encryption-at-rest for file contents, which provides some level of protection. However, the implementation does not meet the industry standard definition of "zero-knowledge" encryption, which requires that metadata also be encrypted client-side before transmission.</p>

    <div class="update-section" id="part2">
        <h1>Part 2: Investigation Update (November 2025)</h1>
        
        <h2>The "BeDrive" Connection</h2>
        <p>Following the initial report, further API analysis has identified that Drime Cloud appears to be running a white-labeled version of <strong>BeDrive</strong>, a generic PHP file-sharing script available on CodeCanyon for approximately $29. The API endpoints and backend structure match BeDrive's architecture closely (with exception of the vault feature).</p>

        <h2>1. The "Military-Grade" Hash Analysis</h2>
        <p>The file identifiers used by Drime are not cryptographically secure hashes. The API returns a "hash" field that, when analyzed, reveals simple obfuscation rather than encryption.</p>
        
        <p><strong>API Response:</strong></p>
        <pre>"hash": "MzQ0NDZ8cGFkZA"</pre>
        
        <p><strong>Decoded (Base64):</strong></p>
        <pre>34446|padd</pre>
        
        <p>This matches the exact PHP source code found in the BeDrive script, which manually pads the ID with the word "padding":</p>
        <pre>public function getHashAttribute(): string {
    return trim(base64_encode(str_pad($this->getRawOriginal('id').'|', 10, 'padding')), '=');
}</pre>
        <img src="screenshots/bedrive_padding.png" alt="Screenshot of Drime(orange text) and BeDrive" class="evidence-image">
        <p>Drime's API response in the orange text, and BeDrive's backend source code.</p>
        <p>This proves that the "secure hash" is merely the sequential database ID encoded in Base64. It is reversible and allows for enumeration of files.</p>

        <h2>2. Active "Zero Knowledge" Deception</h2>
        <p>Drime claimed they "scanned the whole site" to remove incorrect Zero Knowledge claims. This is false.</p>
        <p>As of 4th December 2025, their official blog post <em>"7 Most Secure End-to-End Encrypted Cloud Storage Services Tested in 2025"</em> <strong>still explicitly lists Drime as "Zero Knowledge".</strong></p>

        <p>Continuing to advertise this feature while admitting the architecture does not support it constitutes a Deceptive Commercial Practice.</p>

        <h2>3. Encryption Architecture</h2>
        <p>Update: Following technical disclosure from Drime, I accept that keys are derived client-side. The presence of the IV in the database is standard for this architecture. I have retracted the claim that Drime holds the keys directly.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <h3>New Finding: Weak Encryption Parameters (Below OWASP Standards)</h3>
            <p>While Drime does not "hold" the key, Drime has confirmed they use <strong>PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256</strong> with <strong>250,000 iterations</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Standard:</strong> Current OWASP guidelines recommend a minimum of <strong>600,000 iterations</strong> for this algorithm. Drime uses less than half.</li>
                <li><strong>The Vulnerability:</strong> Unlike Proton (SRP+bcrypt) or Tresorit (scrypt), PBKDF2 is vulnerable to GPU acceleration.</li>
                <li><strong>The Risk:</strong> Drime permits <strong>8-character passwords</strong>. An 8-character password hashed with only 250k iterations of PBKDF2 is trivial to crack via offline brute-force if the database is compromised.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>4. Suspected Artificial Data Inflation</h2>
        <p>By analyzing the sequential database IDs exposed by the BeDrive architecture, we can estimate the actual size of the platform versus the implied size.</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Metric</th>
                <th>Observed ID</th>
                <th>Interpretation</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Vault Files</strong></td>
                <td>~34,446</td>
                <td>The total number of files ever uploaded to the Vault system-wide is only ~34k. This indicates extremely low usage.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Regular Files</strong></td>
                <td>~482,280,015</td>
                <td>This number appears artificially inflated. Given the user ID count (~19k), this would imply 25,000 files per user, which is statistically improbable.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Actual number of files ever uploaded is probably somewhere around ~2,280,015 (without vault).</p>
        <p>It appears the database auto-increment counter was manually set to a high number for regular files to create the appearance of scale, but the admins neglected to inflate the Vault file counter.</p>
        <h2>Final Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Drime is not a trustable or honest company. The Drime founder constantly twists and switches their definitions of E2EE to suit the situation. Their narrative regarding "Zero Knowledge" has shifted repeatedly when challenged:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Marketing Claim:</strong> "Zero Knowledge... Only you can see your files. Not us, not anyone else."</li>
            <li><strong>First Denial:</strong> "We never claimed 'Zero Knowledge'."</li>
            <li><strong>Final Admission:</strong> "We did have a header saying we have 'Zero Knowledge' but we removed it."</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Beyond these verbal inconsistencies, the technical architecture proves the deception. Drime is running a white-labeled instance of a <strong>$29 generic script (BeDrive)</strong>.</p>
                        
        <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Drime is not trustable and users seeking genuine privacy or protection from server-side data breaches should avoid Drime Cloud entirely.</p>

        <h3>⚠️ Detailed Legal & Regulatory Violations (France/EU)</h3>
        <p>Drime Cloud operates from France. The evidence collected in this report suggests the company is currently in violation of the following laws:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Misleading Commercial Practices (Code de la consommation, Art. L121-2):</strong> 
                It is illegal to deceive consumers about the "essential characteristics" of a product. 
                <br><em>The Violation:</em> Marketing "Zero-Knowledge" encryption, and engaging in <strong>Suspected Artificial Data Inflation</strong> (manipulating database counters to display ~482 million regular file uploads, despite the auto-increment IDs showing only ~34,000 Vault files, the extreme discrepancy (34k vs 482M) indicates the regular file counter was artificially inflated) to create false social proof.

            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>GDPR Violations (Articles 5 & 32):</strong> 
                <br><em>The Violation:</em> Lack of transparency and security. Telling users "Only you can see your files" while transmitting file names, types, and sizes in plaintext to the server is a fundamental breach of European data privacy laws.<br>Moreover, as of 11/28/2025, Drime is still advertising their service as "zero knowledge".
